"""
This is a documentation for the usdBuilder HDA's python modules, callbacks,
menu scripts.

USDBuilder is a very lightweight shot builder which would let the user add
sublayers to the root layer.

It is easy to maintain, optimised and quite a good fundamental product for
a pipeline that is looking to start with USD development and toolset.

Dependencies:

    ../setShowBasedEnv : This is a module that might need customisation to
    set your base prod folder as per your current studios folder structure.

    ../../otls/lgmfx_usd_out : User would have to use this HDA to publish.
    Custom folder structure would be necessary. 

Support:

    If needed please contact manx151089@gmail.com for any questions.
